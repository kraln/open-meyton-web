<h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

<p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We process personal data gathered when visiting our websites in compliance with applicable data protection legislation. We neither publish your data nor transmit them to third parties on an unauthorized basis.</p>

<p>In the following section, we explain which data we record when you visit one of our websites, and exactly how they are utilized:</p>

<h3><strong>A. General information</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1. Scope of data processing</strong></p>

<p>As a matter of principle, we gather and utilize users' personal data only to the extent required to ensure the functioning of our website and of our contents and services. The gathering and utilization of our users' personal data normally occurs after users have granted their consent. An exception occurs where data processing is legally permitted.</p>

<p><strong>2. Legal basis of data processing</strong></p>

<p>To the extent that permission of the affected individual is obtained for the processing of personal data, Article 6 (1) lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.</p>

<p>In the processing of personal data to fulfil a contract whose contractual party is the individual affected, Article 6 (1) lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing required to implement pre-contractual measures.</p>

<p>If processing is required to safeguard the justified interest of the MPG or a third party and the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the affected individual do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the basis for such processing.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data deletion and storage duration</strong></p>

<p>The affected individual's personal data are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage ceases to apply. Storage can also occur if provided for by European or national legislators in EU regulations, acts or other legislation to which the MPG is subject. A blocking or deletion of data then occurs only if a storage period prescribed by one of the aforementioned norms expires, unless a necessity exists in relation to the further storage of the data for the arrangement of a contract or the fulfilment of a contract.</p>

<h3><strong>B. Provision of the website and creation of log files</strong></h3>

<p>Each time you visit our website, our service and applications automatically record data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer.</p>

<p>The following data may be gathered temporarily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>Date and time of your access to the website</li>
<li>Address of the page visited</li>
<li>Address of the previously visited website (<em>referrer</em>)</li>
<li>Name and version of your browser/operating system (if transmitted)</li>
</ul>

<p>These data may be stored in our systems' log files. These data are not stored together with the user's other personal data.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the temporary saving of data and log files is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Storage occurs in log files in order to ensure the website's functionality. The data also help us optimize the websites, eliminate malfunctions and ensure our IT system security. Our justified interest in data processing pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR also lies in such purposes.</p>

<p>The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were gathered. If data are gathered for the provision of the website, this is the case if the respective visit is ended. In the instance that data are stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage above and beyond this period is possible. In this case, the users' IP addresses are deleted or removed so they can no longer be allocated to the visiting client.</p>

<p>The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential to operate the website. As a consequence, users do not have an option to revoke such data recording.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing of users' personal data is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Processing of users' personal data enables us to analyze our users' utilization behaviour. The evaluation of the data we obtain enables us to aggregate information about the utilization of our websites' individual components. This helps us constantly improve our websites and their user-friendliness. Our justified interest in data processing pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR also lies in such purposes. The anonymization of the IP address sufficiently takes into consideration users' interest in the protection of their personal data.</p>

<p>The data are deleted after the formation of the conclusive annual sums for access statistics.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that you are able to revoke data gathering. You have the following independent possibilities to revoke data recording by the central server:</p>

<p>In your browser, activate the do-not-track or do-not-follow settings. If these settings are active, our central server will not store any data relating to you. Important: The do-not-track instruction generally applies only for the device and browser in which you activate the setting. If you utilize several devices/browsers, you will need to separately activate do-not-track in all relevant locations.</p>

<p>These data are not stored together with the user's other personal data.</p>

<h3><strong>C. Rights of individuals affected</strong></h3>

<p>As an individual whose personal data are gathered as part of the aforementioned services, you have, in principle, the following rights, to the extent that no legal exceptions are applicable in individual cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information (Article 15 GDPR)</li>
<li>Correction (Article 16 GDPR)</li>
<li>Deletion (Article 17 (1) GDPR)</li>
