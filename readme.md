# Open Meyton Web

A simple, single page application to display XML files from Meyton targeting systems. 

## Description

Meyton targeting systems are used at many ranges, for both firearms and air rifle targets. They output XML files which record information about the participants, shots, etc. from a given competition. This project is a collection of PHP and javascript enabling anyone to easily set up a webpage which can visualize the output of these systems, without too much configuration.

## Getting Started

There are a few tunables in config.php; you should read it and edit them.

### Dependencies

* Requires a fairly modern version of PHP

### Installing

Simply unpack the files to a web-accessible directory, no compilation or post-processing is needed
